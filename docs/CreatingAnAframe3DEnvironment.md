### Creating an Aframe environment

##### A) Modeling the environment
-Create a lightweight environment with as less triangles/polys as possible to have it running smoothly on low-end hardwares
-Can be modeled in any 3d software package. In this case Maya was used.
-Create basic materials with approximate colors (like a light brown for the floor) that can help with the light bakes with bounced lighting.

##### B) Light the environment

-Using a ray tracer render engine (in this case V-ray), light the environment using Domelight (which can use an HDRI for image based lighting), directional lights for sun, and additional rectangular lights for areas that need more illumination.

##### C) Create Lightmap UVs 

-Need to create UVs for the surfaces that need to receive shadows. You can omit the surfaces that are self-illuminating like digital screens or light sources etc. as they donâ€™t receive any shadows
-Combine all the objects that need need to share the lightmap texture. Lay out the UVs in a 0 to 1 UV space as follows. But keep all surface separate for using inside Aframe.

##### D) Bake the lightmaps

-Using the combined geometry that have their UVs in 0 to 1 space, bake the lighting in a lightmap texture using the render engine. After the bake the lightmap should look like this.

##### E) Create the Aframe materials

-Export the separated geometry in .obj files for each material that is needed, for e.g. If you two chairs share a same material they can be combined into a single .obj. But if a single chair has a metallic handle and a cloth back, then both those need to be separated into two .objs.
-Once you have the scene loaded with all the required objs, create the material properties inside Aframe html as needed.
-The geometries that were used for lightmap, will utilize the lightmap textures and the self-illuminating objects will disregard those. Once the materials are set, it should look something like this:

##### F) Create Navmesh
-Navmesh is basically creating the walkable area for the player. So wherever the user is allowed to walk on, there needs to be a 3d model underneath it. Where you want the user to get blocked (like for a wall or desk), delete the 3d surface underneath it.
-If you want the player to go over stairs, have a slope around the stairs on which the player can go on top.

##### G) Customize Branding
-Additional meshes have been added for adding custom logos and desk colors. You can change the URLs to the images and they will be shown in the environment.

For eg. (URLs are dummy)
`<img id="DeskGradient" src="https://99designs-blog.imgix.net/Gradient_builder_2.jpg">`
`<img id="DeskLabels" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/Facebook_Logo.png">`

And they would look like this:

Note:

1) Due to the proportions of the desk, only the center portion of the gradient (or any other image) will be used. Rest won't be shown on the desk.

2) The logo needs to be in a square transparent png (the actual logo can be any proportion, but needs to have transparency padding around it to make it square). This is to avoid the stretching on non-square logos as the 3d model is square.
